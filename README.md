# typeracer-bot
This is a forked from [ErnBern](https://github.com/ErnBern). I have added some extra features like making human like errors from my [Typeracer-Bot](https://github.com/metaversefish/Typeracer-Bot-Local)

## Python Libraries

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

# How to use?
- First of all set your keybinds to start, stop, end the bot
- after finishing that type `start`
- A Chrome browser will be launched
- It will login to your account after a few seconds
- Join a race and then press your start keybind
- You need to press your keybind every time you join a race
- After that the bot will automatically type it
